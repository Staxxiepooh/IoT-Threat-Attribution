# IoT Threat Attribution â€” Minimal Prototype

This repository is a minimal end-to-end prototype for IoT threat detection and attribution using:
- Rule-based detection (blacklists, thresholds)
- ML anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
- MCP-style attacker profiling and context chains
- Simple graph visualization

## Quick start (macOS M1, VS Code)

1. Install Python 3.10/3.11 (Homebrew recommended):
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.11
